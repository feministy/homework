Before we learn how to use jQuery to make API calls, we need to learn how to use JavaScript to make `XMLHttpRequest`s.

**Required reading**

* [Using XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest)
* [XMLHttpRequest basics and tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/)

**Assignment**

Make a series of API calls to the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/) and organize the data as you see fit. You can log your data to the console, or arrange it on the DOM. Up to you!

*Extra credit: write a constructor to organize your data.*

Before you get started, register for a [Sunlight Foundation API key](http://sunlightfoundation.com/api/accounts/register/).

You can pick any of the APIs that appeal to you, but these two are the friendliest for entry level programming:

* [Capitol Words API](http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/capitolwords)
* [Congress API](http://tryit.sunlightfoundation.com/congress)

Note that you can practice your API calls on the Sunlight Foundation page. Make sure to include your API key in the box before trying out a call.

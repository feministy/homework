This is the first of many lessons where we are going to be focusing on object-oriented programming principles. We're starting small with the concept of constructors in JavaScript.

**Required reading**

* [JavaScript Constructors and Prototypes](http://tobyho.com/2010/11/22/javascript-constructors-and/)
* [MDN `Object.prototype.constructor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor)
* [Object-oriented programming in JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/chapter8.html) *this is a little advanced, but very important*

**Assignment**

Write at least one constructor with *complete test coverage*.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

* Class roster
* Wardrobe catalog
* Aquarium
* Zoo
* Cash register
